### PRINTF Implementation

The PRINTF function is a standard C library function that is used to print formatted output to the console.

To implement PRINTF in Markdown, we can use the following steps:

1. Define a macro called `PRINTF()`. This macro will take a format string and a variable number of arguments as input, and it will print the formatted output to the console.
2. Inside the `PRINTF()` macro, we will use the following logic:
    * Iterate over the format string, one character at a time.
    * If the current character is a format specifier, then print the corresponding argument to the console.
    * Otherwise, print the current character to the console.
